# **App Name**: ReadmeBuddy Web

## Core Features:

- AI Readme Generation: Accept a GitHub repository URL and use the ReadmeBuddy tool to automatically generate a comprehensive README.md file, enhancing project documentation and discoverability. This tool scans the repository and its file to infer information that is later used to compose the markdown.
- Simple Project Input: Provide a user-friendly web interface where users can input their repository URL or project path. Use simple copy and paste interaction pattern.
- Display and Copy README: Display the generated README.md content in a text area that the user can easily copy.
- Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully, informing users of issues such as invalid URLs, inaccessible repositories, or problems during the README generation process.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey a sense of intelligence, authority, and efficiency, all appropriate to this use case.
- Background color: Very light Indigo (#E8EAF6), very close to white but not pure white, to be easy on the eyes when the user is focused on writing code.
- Accent color: Violet (#7E57C2), for supplementary user interface elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clean, readable text, suitable for both headers and body content.
- Use minimalist, professional icons from a set like FontAwesome to represent actions like 'copy', 'generate', and 'error'.
- Keep the layout clean and straightforward with a clear separation between the input area, generation button, and output display. Use a single-column layout for readability.
- Add subtle animations (e.g., a loading spinner or a smooth transition when the README is generated) to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
